#My DotFiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.
## Added scripts, Makefile, vimrc and bashrc config
This set of scripts contain my current vimrc and bashrc
configurations. If you would like to get my vimrc and bashrc
configurations, you can download the the scripts and the makefile,
and run it in your home directory. The makefile will use the linux.sh and cleanup.sh scripts to add alias and more useful things to your shell to make it more intuitive and easier to use. With that being said, happy searching!!
